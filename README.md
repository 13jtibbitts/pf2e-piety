# Pathfinder 2e Piety
Using the Victory Points subsytem, this module provides a conversion to DnD5e's Piety system.

A Piety section is added to the Effects tab of a character sheet, just below Divine Intercessions. It includes information about the character's deity, and provides the ability to add edicts and anathemas that increase or decrease Piety.

There is also the ability drag Deity Boons (or Curses) to slots corresponding to the Piety thresholds.
