# Pathfinder 2e Piety
Using the Victory Points subsytem, this module provides a conversion to DnD5e's Piety system.

A Piety section is added to the Effects tab of a character sheet, just below Divine Intercessions. It includes information about the character's deity, and provides the ability to add edicts and anathemas that increase or decrease Piety.

There is also the ability drag Deity Boons (or Curses) to slots corresponding to the Piety thresholds.

<!-- PHASE 1:
- One tab (Overview)
-- Have Current Deity, option to add edicts and anathema, and drag and drop Deity Boons to thresholds.
-- Static Piety thresholds, no automation based on Piety score.

PHASE 2: Settings and Automation
- Add settings. Customizable thresholds and Curses option.
- Automatically grant boons/curses based on Piety score and thresholds.
- Give Piety score a negative option to have a Curses scale.

PHASE 3: Details Tab
- Add details tab.
-- Deity and description.
-- Edicts and anathema pulled from overview tab / edict array (no adding).
-- Threshold boon descriptions.

PHASE 4: GM Goals
- Add a Goals tab.
-- Ability to add Obstacles to help determine when Piety should increase.
